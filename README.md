# DBokeh

This is my personal photography portfolio website. It's a place for me (Devansh) to showcase my photos and experiment with web design and features I find interesting. The code and content here are tailored for my own use—it's not meant to be a reusable template or open for contributions.

## About

DBokeh is a simple, responsive site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a gallery, dark mode, and a few accessibility touches. All photos and text are my own.

## Why?

I wanted a space to display my photography and play around with web development. That's all!
